# AgentMail — Agent-Owned Email Inboxes

## Requirements

- **AgentMail API key** (required) — sign up at https://console.agentmail.to (free tier: 3 inboxes, 3,000 emails/month; paid plans from $20/mo)
- Node.js 18+ (for the MCP server)

## When to Use
Use this skill when you need to:
- Give the agent its own dedicated email address
- Send emails autonomously on behalf of the agent
- Receive and read incoming emails
- Manage email threads and conversations
- Sign up for services or authenticate via email
- Communicate with other agents or humans via email

This is NOT for reading the user's personal email (use `himalaya` or a Gmail integration for that).
AgentMail gives the agent its own identity and inbox.

## Setup

### 1. Get an API Key
- Go to https://console.agentmail.to
- Create an account and generate an API key (starts with `am_`)

### 2. Configure MCP Server

In Claude Code, register the MCP server. Either add an entry to your MCP configuration
file (typically `~/.claude/mcp.json`) or use the `claude mcp add` CLI. Paste your
actual key — the MCP launcher reads the `env` block directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentmail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "agentmail-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AGENTMAIL_API_KEY": "am_your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Claude Code

Restart your Claude Code session so it picks up the new MCP server. All 11 AgentMail
tools are then available automatically.

## Available Tools (via MCP)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_inboxes` | List all agent inboxes |
| `get_inbox` | Get details of a specific inbox |
| `create_inbox` | Create a new inbox (gets a real email address) |
| `delete_inbox` | Delete an inbox |
| `list_threads` | List email threads in an inbox |
| `get_thread` | Get a specific email thread |
| `send_message` | Send a new email |
| `reply_to_message` | Reply to an existing email |
| `forward_message` | Forward an email |
| `update_message` | Update message labels/status |
| `get_attachment` | Download an email attachment |

## Procedure

### Create an inbox and send an email
1. Create a dedicated inbox:
   - Use `create_inbox` with a username (e.g. `my-agent`)
   - The agent gets address: `my-agent@agentmail.to`
2. Send an email:
   - Use `send_message` with `inbox_id`, `to`, `subject`, `text`
3. Check for replies:
   - Use `list_threads` to see incoming conversations
   - Use `get_thread` to read a specific thread

### Check incoming email
1. Use `list_inboxes` to find your inbox ID
2. Use `list_threads` with the inbox ID to see conversations
3. Use `get_thread` to read a thread and its messages

### Reply to an email
1. Get the thread with `get_thread`
2. Use `reply_to_message` with the message ID and your reply text

## Example Workflows

**Sign up for a service:**
```
1. create_inbox (username: "signup-bot")
2. Use the inbox address to register on the service
3. list_threads to check for verification email
4. get_thread to read the verification code
```

**Agent-to-human outreach:**
```
1. create_inbox (username: "my-outreach")
2. send_message (to: user@example.com, subject: "Hello", text: "...")
3. list_threads to check for replies
```

## Pitfalls
- Free tier limited to 3 inboxes and 3,000 emails/month
- Emails come from `@agentmail.to` domain on free tier (custom domains on paid plans)
- Node.js (18+) is required for the MCP server (`npx -y agentmail-mcp`)
- Real-time inbound email (webhooks) requires a public server — use `list_threads` polling on a schedule for personal use

## Verification
After setup, ask Claude Code to "create an AgentMail inbox called `test-agent` and tell me its email address". If the MCP server is wired up correctly, the agent returns the new inbox address.
